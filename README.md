Task : Given a person’s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.

To classify credit scores based on credit-related information, here’s an outline for building a machine-learning model:

### 1. **Problem Understanding**
   - **Goal**: Classify the credit score into different categories (e.g., Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor) based on a person's credit-related information.
   - **Type**: This is a multi-class classification problem.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Dataset**: A credit-related dataset with features like credit history, payment behaviour, loan type, number of open accounts, total credit usage, etc.
   - **Target Variable**: Credit score category (label).

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Impute missing values, if any, using median or mode for numerical and categorical features, respectively, or mode of each group.
   - **Detect strange values**: removing any unwanted characters; for example, for the Age column, it represents _32 instead of 32.
   - **Fixing a data type**: Some numeric columns wrongly represent Objects.
   - **Scaling**: Use standard scaling (StandardScaler) or normalization to standardize numerical features.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Remove or impute mode value to reduce skewness.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze correlations between features and the target variable.
   - Visualize distributions, relationships, and feature importance.

### 5. **Model Selection**
   - **Models**: Try algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, as these are effective for classification tasks.
   - **Evaluation Metric**: Use metrics like F1 score, accuracy, or AUC-ROC based on the business needs.

### 6. **Model Training**
   - **Cross-validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance across different folds.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune model hyperparameters.

### 7. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluate classification performance for each class.
   - **Precision and Recall**: Ensure the model minimizes false positives and false negatives where necessary.
